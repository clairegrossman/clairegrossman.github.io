<p> Page 1:
    the page is written in english so I declared the overall language of the page by adding the html tag lang="en"
    the doctype was not defined before the start tag so I added <!DOCTYPE html> before <head>
    typo for italisizing text, corrected to <em></em> line 85
    the p tag was not correctly closed in line 78
</p>
<p> Page 2:
    line 27 - bolding the New Beehive Inn was incomplete, missing the closing b tag
    line 53 - h2 is not allowed as child element of b so I moved bold element inside header 2
    line 57 - the link "where do i go" doesn't go anywhere, so i linked the wiki page for segmental arch
    line 41 - broken link did't lead anywhere so I linked the wiki page for "bay"
</p>
<p>
    Page 3:
    line 53 fix list, change <l></l> to <li></li> list item
    line 85 <td>Lily</td> was missing its closing tag
    line 98 start tag was in table body, needed to be indented
    line 98 - alexias name was outside the final tr element, had to rearrange names and ages accordingly
    line 80 -change th to <td></td>
</p>
<p>
    page 4:
    doctype was not defined before start tage so i added !DOCTYPE html
    each image needed alt text description
    line 48 - missing td start tag
    line 43 - missing td element
    line 38 - missing closing td
    fixed the grid of pictures by making sure each had td element
