<h1>Changelog</h1>

<h3><u>Page 1</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>The error was that the start tag for h2 was seen in the table. To fix this I added a closing tr tag and closing table tag above the h2 element. </li>
    <li>One of the items in the unordered list was missing its closing li tag so I added it. </li>
    <li> In the table one of the cells was left open so I added its missing closing td tag. </li>
    <li>Line 30 was missing a closing p tag for the paragraph so I corrected that.</li>
    <li>The document is written in English so I defined the language using lang="en" in the html tag at the start of the code.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Page 2</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>On line 27 the bolding element for "New Beehive Inn" was imcomplete so I added the missing /b in the closing tag.</li>
    <li>There was an error because h2 is not allowed as a child element of b so I moved the bolding tag inside the header 2 element. </li>
    <li> There was an error with the href link "where do I go" on line 57 because there was no link provided. I replaced it with a link to the wikipedia page for segmental arches</li>
    <li>There was no closing tag for the history header so first I corrected that. Then I noticed that it was the only section title using h6 so I changed it to h2 to match the rest of the document. </li>
    <li>Some sections but not all had hr elements to create a break between bodies of text so I rearranged and added a couple hr elemtns to have consistent organization.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Page 3</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>The error was the the start tag was seen with out defining the doctype so I corrected it to say that the doctype was html as the first line of code.</li>
    <li> The head element was empty so I added meta data including characterset and viewing information. I also added a title and linked the css style sheet.</li>
    <li>The footer was interfering with other sections on the page, above the form and not at the foot of the page. I changed the position from absolute to bottom on the style sheet.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Page 4</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li> The doctype was not defiend before the start tag to I added "!DOCTYPE html" as the first line of code</li>
    <li> each image was missing its alt text so I added a description of each image using alt="description"</li>
    <li> Some images were missing parts of a td element. I made sure each image had a td element to correct the grid</li>
    <li> I rearranged where the images were placed in the grip so they corresponded with the correct title.</li>
</ul>
