<h1>Changelog</h1>

<h3><u>Page 1</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>The language of the page was not defined so since it was written in english I defined it as lang="en"</li>
    <li>The doctype was not defined before the start tag so I added DOCTYPE as html before the head tag</li>
    <li>On line 81 there was a typo for italisizing the text so I corrected "cr√®me fraiche" to be within the "em" element </li>
    <li>There was an error on line 75 because the p tag was no correctly closed so I added the closing p tag</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Page 2</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>On line 27 the bolding element for "New Beehive Inn" was imcomplete so I added the closing b tag</li>
    <li>h2 is not allowed as a child element of b so I moved the bolding tag inside the h2 element </li>
    <li> There was an error with the href link "where do I go" on line 57 because there was no link provided. I replaced it with a link to the wikipedia page for segmental arches</li>
    <li>There was another error with the link on line 41 "brokenlink.com" becuase the webiste didnt exist so I replaced it with a link the the wikipedia page for "bay"</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Page 3</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>There was a problem with the list item on line 53 because there was an "l" tag instead of an "li" tag, so I changed it to an "li" tag</li>
    <li> Inside the table there was a table header tag (th) where there should've been just a td tag since it was just a data cell in the table not a header, so I switched th to td.</li>
    <li>On line 85 the name "Lily" was missing its closing tag for its position in the table. I added the missing "td" closing tag.</li>
    <li>The names and ages were not correctly grouped in the table to I reorganized so that each row (tr) had a first name, last name, and age. </li>
    <li> On line 98 the start tag for "td" was inside the table body, so I indented it</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Page 4</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li> The doctype was not defiend before the start tag to I added "!DOCTYPE html" as the first line of code</li>
    <li> each image was missing its alt text so I added a description of each image using alt="description"</li>
    <li> Line 43 was missing a td element so I added it surrounding the image tag</li>
    <li> Line 48 only had a closing td tag so I added the missing start tag</li>
    <li> The grid of pictures was wonky to start so I made sure each image had a start and close td tag to create a 3x3 grid of images </li>

</ul>
